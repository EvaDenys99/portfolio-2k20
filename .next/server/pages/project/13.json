The requirements where that the design would translate their brand also that the uploading of new projects and other content is an easy process.\n&nbsp\nIn the above picture you can see how their old website looked.","goal":"*The goal*\n&nbsp\nis to show off their amazing work!\n&nbsp\n\n*How to meet their requests *\n&nbsp\nFor the design I worked with the tool Sketch and sometimes Illustrations for icons, I worked closely with the client to make sure that the design is everything they wanted. To make the begin video with the XX I used After Effects.\n&nbsp\nTo make the upload of new projects easy for the client I used the open-source headless CMS Strapi, I find it easy in use as developer and very user friendly for the client. I used Cloudinary for storage image upload and vimeo api player for the videos they want in their projects. Then I used Vercel to deploy the new website.","download":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
