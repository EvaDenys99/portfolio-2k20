First we would need to research everything of the client and their problem, then come up with a solution that fits best. This solution should be worked out with our development and design skills.\n\n### The problem\nThe people who go to NEXT Festival, stay within their own district. NEXT Festival wants to make sure that people also go to the festival outside of their ow district. They also want that more people know what the Eurometropool is and what they do. ","goal":"### Goal audience\nThe core user group of our project is people who are interested in art. For example, people that like to go to a museum, that are busy with fashion or music, ... This user group can know NEXT Festival and maybe even have been to the festival, but that is not necessary. \n\n### Offline campaign\nPosters will hang on locations where our user group hangs out. They are found in places like an art academy, the libary, music school, some theaters.\nThese people will be triggered by these posters, to surf to our web application and take on the challenge with themselves. \n\n### Online campaign\nThe online campaign will be brought on social media. Our persona (Livia) sees an Instagram banner and is able to come on our web application with only one single click. She is intrigued by the idea of literally extending herself and her limits.\n\n### Design\n\n#### Colors\nOur color palet is chosen because of the psychology behind them. Orange is a warm color, that activates, but also emits creativity and impulsivity. From research, we know that creativity and impulsivity are a big quality of our user group. Because of this, it is the perfect color for Nextend.\n\n#### Fonts\nThe fonts are chosen on a basis of characteristics of our user group, but also for the chosen device. The detail font emits creativity and impulsivity. The main font is a sans-serif font, because of the good readabilty on a mobile device.\n\n#### Icons\nThe icons are based of the font ‘Living Selflessly’. This because of the feeling of creativity and impulsivity that is passed onto the icons. \n\nTo see the whole design look at the included images.","download":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
