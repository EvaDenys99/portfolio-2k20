The art house focuses on major works from opera, ballet and dance history, on contemporary creations and masterpieces to be rediscovered. Her performances are of the highest quality, are unconventional and relevant to today's audience. The organization is therefore an important player on a national and international level.\n\nIt uses its resources in a transparent manner and with the greatest possible efficiency to generate the maximum output of performances and activities, appealing to the most diversified audience of all ages and socio-cultural backgrounds: opera and ballet / dance are there for everyone The organization continuously strives to fulfill its social and artistic mission in an innovative way.

It is aware of\nhis role and actively cooperates with other cultural institutions in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\n","goal":"To find out more about the target group, we started doing fieldwork. This consisted of conducting interviews with the target group in order to gain insights, and making a survey to gauge the target group's opinion about opera and ballet. We also visited the OBV in Antwerp and Ghent to find out more about the process of a production and what is involved.\n\n### Survey\nThe survey we conducted was to map out the general picture of opera and ballet among the target group. It turned out that those surveyed see opera and ballet as a boring night out for the elite. It is striking that most indicate that they have never been there and consider it \"boring\". This is a very distorted picture as most of them have no experience with this art form. If the people have been, their opinion is very positive with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10.\nWe also spoke to a ballerina to learn more about the world she is in.\n\n### PushLines \n\n#### First interaction\nWhen opening the box, you will see a holographic projection instead of a rotating ballerina figure.\nThis hologram will be supported by the music you can experience at Opera Ballet Vlaanderen. By using a hologram we are not limited to using one image. This allows us to give impressions of all the experiences OBV offers. Opera, ballet, and even the yet to be determined art form that will be shown in the “third house”.\nA QR code will also be present in the box. QR codes can be scanned with all smartphones via the built-in camera, making it easy to reach the web application. In this application the user can see which performances can be seen and where they take place. The user can also purchase tickets for the performances here.\n\n#### In the opera house\nWhen visiting the opera house, the user will be reminded to log in to the PushLines web application. After registration, the user can take a seat in the room and enjoy the performance. During this performance, PushLines will send different push notifications to the registered users, which will be divided among all the registrations, so we ensure that not everyone gets the same notifications.\nThrough these notifications, users will receive helpful tips and details about the show, without having to unlock their phone. In this way, each user will have a unique experience during the performance, while unwanted phone use is minimized.\n\n#### Added value\nNormally, phone use during a performance is a big taboo. On the other hand, we cannot deny that the use of telephones has become a huge part of today's society. PushLines makes it possible to combine the constant need for our telephones with enjoying a performance in peace and quiet. For the younger generation it can be a starting point to give opera or ballet a chance, because in this way it becomes more accessible to visit a performance.","download":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
