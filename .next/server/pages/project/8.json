You will be given the space to experiment, explore and take on new challenges.\n&nbsp\nThe expert module offers the opportunity to really immerse yourself. You are given the space to abandon the regular fulfillment of the school assignments. You will of course use the knowledge you have gained during your 2 years of Devine. However, Devine is also \"lifelong learning\". In this module you show that you can expand your knowledge through independent research and / or exploration, separate from the already learned material. In short, challenge yourself as a developer.\n&nbsp\nPersonal experiment and research are important. So you will not run production for a commercial partner.\n&nbsp","goal":"\nDuke is a quadruped robot with a really arrogant personality, every time he executes an order he will bow at the end. \nHe also is the typical football jock. \n","download":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
